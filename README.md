# Zillow Data Analysis

As a Minnesota resident and future home buyer, I spend a lot time on Zillow tracking home prices across different cities in my state. Zillow provides a large amount of information for each listing and I wanted a way to programatically collect this information so that I could dive deeper and create my own visualizations for the data.

In order to accomplish this, I used the script ZillowScraper.py to gather lisiting data from 4 cities of interest:

- Richfield
- Woodbury
- Minneapolis
- Bloomington

The questions that I hope to answer during the analysis portion of this project are:

1. How does price vary by city in the dataset?
2. Which variables have the strongest correlations with price?
3. How many listings in each city have decreased the asking price? How much was the asking price decreased?
4. Which cities have living spaces that cover the largest proportion of total lot size?

Finally, I will end by creating models to predict the price of a home using city , number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, living area sqft , and total lot area sqft. Comparing this "predicted price" with the actual price on the listing can help find homes priced signiifcantly below expectation that could be a good value for the buyer.
